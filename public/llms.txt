# ClaudeMD Generator

> Generate high-quality CLAUDE.md files from a guided questionnaire for AI coding agents.

ClaudeMD Generator is a free web application that helps developers create structured CLAUDE.md instruction files for AI coding agents like Claude, Cursor, and Copilot. Through a 27-section guided questionnaire, it captures project context — stack, architecture, rules, commands, security policies — and generates a concise, actionable markdown file that agents read before working on your codebase.
